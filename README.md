Machine Learning SAT
====================

* Machine Learning Based SAT Solver for Dual Degree Project treating SAT as a classification problem
  - SATZilla - Source Code from the official SATZilla Website to extract features
  - The features are used to populate and prepare a feature based DB
  - This feature DB is then trained on examples from the SAT Competion
  - Current Models obtain accuracy of ~80% on average using MLP ALgorithms
  -Work currently in progress...
